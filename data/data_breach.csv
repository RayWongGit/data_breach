That they were going to try and hide it."" Aetna said someone from the company made a ""serious human error,"" and it will now go through the files to make sure no sensitive information was lost. What's more troubling, the woman said, is that the bureau wasn't the only piece of furniture offered for free that day. ""Out of the pieces that were up for grabs, whose to say that I've got the only piece that was full of Aetna papers."" The woman has also contacted the state to investigate the situation. Aetna has clients across the country.UPDATE (8/2/10): Aetna notified 7,250 clients of the breach and reported that 6,372 were affected.

It discovered the intrusion mid-December 2006. Transaction data from 2003 as well as mid-May through December 2006 may have been accessed. According to its Web site, TJX is the leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide.Note on our total: included in this breach are 45,700,000 credit and debit card account numbers; 455,000 merchandise return records containing customer names and driver's license numbers; recovery of about 200,000 stolen credit card account numbers; records then 1indicated an additional 48 million people have been affected. Totals were estimated at 94 million but now seem to have affected over 100 million accounts.UPDATE  (2/22/2007):TJX said that while it first thought the intrusion took place from May 2006 to January 2007, it now thinks its computer system was also hacked in July 2005 and on various subsequent dates that year.UPDATE (3/21/2007): Information stolen from TJX's systems was being used fraudulently in November 2006 in an $8 million gift card scheme, one month before TJX officials said they learned of the breach, according to Florida law enforcement officials.

UPDATE (04/26/2007): Three states' banking associations (MA, CT, and ME) filed a class action lawsuit against TJX to recover the costs of damages totaling tens of millions of dollars incurred for replacing customers' debit and credit cards. UPDATE (05/04/2007): An article in the WSJ notes that because TJX had an outdated wireless security encryption system, had failed to install firewalls and data encryption on computers using the wireless network, and had not properly install another layer of security software it had bought, thieves were able to access data streaming between hand-held price-checking devices, cash registers and the store's computers. 21 U.S. and Canadian lawsuits seek damages from the retailer for reissuing compromised cards. UPDATE (07/10/2007): U.S. Secret Service agents found TJX customers' credit card numbers in the hands of Eastern European cyber thieves who created high-quality counterfeit credit cards.

Breach costs have been estimated at $216 million. UPDATE (11/30/2007): Fifth Third Bancorp, the Ohio bank that was fined $880,000 by Visa for its role in the customer data security breach at TJX Cos., the largest ever, also paid fines and compensation totaling $1.4 million following the loss of data from BJ's Wholesale Club Inc.

UPDATE (2/10/2008): Notices are going out to millions of customers who may have had credit card information compromised in a data breach. The notices contain information about eligibility for compensation such as vouchers and credit monitoring to be provided under a proposed settlement. UPDATE (4/2/2008): TJX Cos. reached a settlement with MasterCard Inc. in which it will pay up to $24 million to banks and other institutions to cover fraud losses stemming from a massive data breach disclosed last year. They also struck a similar deal with rival card network Visa in which it agreed to pay up to $40.9 million. As in that deal, TJX said the costs of its MasterCard settlement are included in the $256 million the company has set aside to pay for computer work and other costs associated with the breach. UPDATE (5/14/2008): The TJX Companies, Inc. today announced that it completed its previously announced settlement with MasterCard International Incorporated and its issuers.

UPDATE (8/5/2008): Eleven perpetrators allegedly involved in the hacking of nine major U.S. retailers have been charged with numerous crimes, including conspiracy, computer intrusion, fraud and identity theft. This is the largest hacking and identity theft case ever prosecuted by the U.S. Department of Justice. An indictment was returned on Aug. 5, 2008. Conspirators obtained the credit and debit card numbers by wardriving and hacking into the wireless computer networks of major retailers -- including TJX Companies, BJ's Wholesale Club, OfficeMax, Boston Market, Barnes & Noble, Sports Authority, Forever 21 and DSW. The indictments are the result of a three-year undercover investigation conducted out of the San Diego Field Office of the U.S. Secret Service. UPDATE (8/30/2008): TrustCo BankCorp NY sued TJX in August 2008 to recoup costs it incurred from reissuing an estimated 4,000 customer MasterCard debit cards after hackers accessed the TJX computer network. The bank stated its cost for the breach was up to $20 per affected account, explaining that it suffered losses from administrative expenses and lost interest and transaction fees. Later in the month, TJX in turn claimed that Trustco failed to implement policies or procedures that would have enabled the bank to avoid canceling and replacing customer debit cards. UPDATE (9/22/2008):One of the 11 people arrested last month in connection with the massive data theft at T JX Companies Inc., BJ Wholesale Clubs Inc. and several other retailers pleaded guilty yesterday to four felony counts, including wire and credit card fraud and aggravated identity theft. Many of the Internet attacks that he facilitated were SQL injection attacks, according to court documents. The stolen data was sold to cyber criminals in Eastern Europe and the U.S. or used to make fraudulent credit and debit cards. UPDATE (6/26/2009): TJX has agreed to pay $9.75 million to 41 states and to implement and maintain a comprehensive information security program, designed to safeguard consumer data and address any weaknesses in TJX's systems in place at the time of the breach. Of the $9.75 million monetary payment under the settlement, $5.5 million is to be dedicated to data protection and consumer protection efforts by the states, and $1.75 million is to reimburse the costs and fees of the investigation. Further, $2.5 million of the settlement will fund a Data Security Trust Fund to be used by the state Attorneys General to advance enforcement efforts and policy development in the field of data security and protecting consumers’ personal information. UPDATE (7/28/2009): Pennsylvania and 40 other states reached a $9.75 million settlement. UPDATE (9/4/2009): TJX settles for $525K with four banks. As part of the settlement with AmeriFirst Bank, Trustco Bank, HarborOne Credit Union and SELCO Community Credit Union, the Framingham, Mass.-based retailer paid $525,000. The money primarily will be used to cover the banks' expenses in pursuing the legal action.UPDATE (12/15/2009):A Miami hacker who had already pleaded guilty to computer fraud and identity theft for breaches at retailers T.J. Maxx, OfficeMax, and many other merchants, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to similar charges related to breaches at Heartland Payment Systems, 7-11, Hannaford Brothers supermarkets, and two other companies. Albert Gonzalez, 28, reiterated terms of a plea agreement in U.S. District Court in Boston. A week earlier, co-conspirator Stephen Watt of New York, appeared in that same court and was ordered to serve two years in prison and pay $171.5 million in restitution for developing a sniffing program used to grab payment card data in the breach at the TJX companies between 2003 and 2008. UPDATE (3/17/2010): Humza Zaman, a co-conspirator in the hack of TJX and other companies, was sentenced in Boston to 46 months in prison and fined $75,000 for his role in the conspiracy. The sentence matches what prosecutors were seeking. Zaman was charged with laundering between $600,000 and $800,000 for hacker Albert Gonzalez, who is currently awaiting sentencing on charges that he and others hacked into TJX, Office Max, Heartland Payment Systems and numerous other companies to steal data on more than 100 million credit and debit card accounts. Zaman pleaded guilty in April to one count of conspiracy. His sentence includes three years of supervised release with the condition that Zaman must disclose his conviction to any future employer. Upon release, Zaman will not be barred from using computers. Zaman is the second conspirator in the TJX case to be charged. Former Morgan Stanley coder, Stephen Watt, was sentenced in December to two years in prison for his role in the TJX case, which involved supplying Gonzalez with a sniffer program used to siphon card data from the TJX network. UPDATE (3/29/2010): A 28-year-old college dropout who became the world’s biggest credit card hacker on Thursday was sentenced to 20 years in prison for stealing millions of credit union and bank account records from TJX Cos., BJ’s Wholesale Club, Office Max, Dave & Busters, Barnes & Noble and a string of other companies – even as he was working as a $75,000-a-year undercover informant for the U.S. government in identity theft cases. But that’s not the end of it, as Albert Gonzalez is scheduled to be sentenced again to additional years behind bars for additional data thefts at Heartland Payment Systems, Hannaford Bros. supermarkets and 7-Eleven convenience stores. The theft of credit card data cost financial institutions, insurers and cardholders an estimated $200 million, according to law enforcement. JC Penney and Wet Seal were both officially added to the list of retail victims of Albert Gonzalez on Friday (March 26) when U.S. District Court Judge Douglas P. Woodlock refused to continue their cloak of secrecy and removed the seal from their names. StorefrontBacktalk had reported last August that $17 billion JC Penney chain was one of Gonzalez.s victims, even though JC Penney's media representatives were denying it. But the $561 million chain Wet Seal, which has 504 stores in 47 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico, had kept their identity secret. No more and that.s the way Woodlock wanted it. UPDATE (4/16/2010): Damon Patrick Toey, the 'trusted subordinate' of TJX hacker Albert Gonzalez, was sentenced in Boston to 5 more years in prison. He also received a $100,000 fine and three years. supervised release, according to the Justice Department.UPDATE (7/8/2010): TJX has settled another lawsuit.  The Louisiana Municipal Police Employees' Retirement System, a shareholder of TJX stock, settled with TJX for $595,000 in legal fees and enhanced oversight of customer files.UPDATE (4/8/2011): Albert Gonzalez is appealing his conviction for his role in a
large data breach by claiming that his actions were authorized by the Secret
Service.  The government acknowledged that Gonzalez was a key undercover Secret Service informant at the time of the breaches.  In a 25-page petition, Gonzalez faulted one of his attorney's for failing to prepare a ""Public Authority"" defense, which would have argued that he committed crimes with the approval of government authorities.",Dataloss DB,,2007,42.291762,-71.425895,Hacker,Outsider,Online,Network,Northeast,Northeast,12,non_F_regulated,Others,120.25447409260205,10.0,10,3,20.0,13.0,23.0,7.666666666666667,16.333333333333336

The physical and mental health information included a checklist of 22 different chronic medical conditions that patients did or did not have.  This was without the knowledge or consent of patients and the Attorney General argues that patients had the right to know how their information was being used and to have it kept confidential.Accretive tells investors that its contracts with hospitals include risk scoring patients, reducing avoidable hospital admissions, identifying the sickest and most impact-able patients for proactive management, and identifying real-time interventions with significant revenue or cost impact. The lawsuit alleges that Accretive violated state and federal health privacy laws, state debt collection laws, and state consumer protection laws.  It seeks an order requiring Accretive to fully disclose to patients: 1) what information it has about Minnesota patients; 2) what information it has lost about Minnesota patients; 3) where and to whom it has sent information about Minnesota patients; and 4) the purposes for which it amasses and uses information about Minnesota patients. In addition, the lawsuit asks Accretive to disclose whether it has sent health data about Minnesota patients to an offshore site in new Delhi, India and requests that restrictions be applied to how Accretive treats and uses patient data.The press release from the Office of Minnesota Attorney General Lori Swanson can be found here.UPDATE (08/24/2012): A settlement agreement with Accretive Health was announced at the end of July.  The settlement requires Accretive to stop doing business in Minnesota for two years and to pay approximately $2.5 million to the State of Minnesota, a portion of which will be used to compensate patients.",Databreaches.net,,2011,37.09024,-95.712891,Others,Mixed,Offline,Local,Midwest,Midwest,13,F_regulated,Others,0.028259801411761484,10.0,7,10,17.0,20.0,27.0,9.0,3.0

Michaels is accused of knowingly violating federal and state law by failing to take reasonable steps to safeguard customers' personal information.  Michaels is also accused of failing to alert customers as soon as the security breach was discovered.

This incident may be the result of a global cyberfraud operation. UPDATE (01/26/2009): Heartland Payment Systems has been sued. The lawsuit seeks damages and relief for the inexplicable delay, questionable timing, and inaccuracies concerning the disclosures with regard to the data breach, which is believed to be the largest in U.S. history. UPDATE (02/12/2009): According to BankInfoSecurity.com, the number of financial institutions that have come forward to say they have been contacted by their credit card companies Visa and MasterCard in relation to the breach has jumped from fewer than 50 to more than 200. UPDATE (06/04/2009): While it's hard to get a handle on just how many consumers were affected by the Heartland Payment Systems (HPY) data breach, the total number of institutions now reporting card compromises is at 656. UPDATE (06/16/2009): Heartland lawsuits to be heard in Texas. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation in Louisville, KY issued its decision to consolidate the class action suits. The lawsuits will be heard in the Southern District Court of Texas in Houston. Thirty-one separate lawsuits, on behalf of consumers, investors, banks and credit unions, have been filed against Princeton,N.J.-based Heartland. UPDATE (07/06/2009): Heartland Payment Systems successfully completed the first phase of an end-to-end encryption pilot project designed to enhance its security. UPDATE (08/20/2009): Albert Segvec Gonzalez has been indicted by a federal grand jury in New Jersey - along with two unnamed Russian conspirators - on charges of hacking into Heartland Payment Systems, the New Jersey-based card processing company, as well as Hannaford Brothers, 7-Eleven and two unnamed national retailers, according to the indictment unsealed Monday. Gonzalez, a former Secret Service informant, is already awaiting trial over his involvement in the TJX hack.Total records breached: 100 million transactions per month. It is unclear how many account numbers have been compromised, and how many are represented by multiple transactions. The number of records breached is an estimate, subject to revision. UPDATE (08/20/2009): According to the court document, hackers stole more than 130 million credit and debit card numbers from Heartland and Hannaford combined.UPDATE (05/12/2010): The costs to Heartland Payment Systems Inc. from the massive data breach that it disclosed in January 2009 appear to be steadily adding up. Quarterly financial results released by Heartland last week show that the card payment processor has accrued $139.4 million in breach-related expenses. The figure includes a settlement totaling nearly $60 million with Visa, another of about $3.5 million with American Express and more than $26 million in legal fees. That total also includes $42.8 million that Heartland has set aside to fund proposed settlements with several other litigants over the breach. One example of what the fund is set up for is Heartland's offer to settle several consumer class action lawsuits against it for four million. So far, Heartland has recovered about $30 million from insurance companies.UPDATE (06/02/2010): Heartland Payment Systems has made a third settlement deal, this time with MasterCard, related to a massive data breach two years ago at the card payments processor. As part of the deal, Heartland has agreed to pay as much as US$41.1 million to MasterCard issuers that lost money as a result of the data breach. The deal is contingent on financial institutions representing 80 percent of the affected MasterCard accounts accepting the offer by June 25. MasterCard is recommending that issuers accept the offer.UPDATE (09/01/2010): Heartland Payment Systems has agreed to settle with Discover for five million dollars.  Discover will use the money to cover costs of fraud incidents and reissuing cards.UPDATE (09/19/2010): Jerome Abaquin Gonzales is expected to surrender to police and serve jail time for participating in a credit card forgery ring which used information from the Heartland breach.  The information came from the 4.2 million Discover credit card customers who used their cards at Hannaford Brothers.UPDATE (09/22/2010): Thomas Michio Taniguchi was sentenced to prison for his role in the forgery ring in which Jerome Abaquin Gonzales also participated.UPDATE (12/07/2011): Heartland legal representatives were able to successfully argue that most of the claims against Heartland that were filed by nine banks should be dismissed. All but one claim was dismissed.UPDATE (02/12/2012): The nine banks may have had their claims against Heartland dismissed because Heartland reported that sharing a contractual relationship with the banks defeats their appeal. However, the credit-card-issuing banks are arguing that a New Jersey economic loss rule only bars claims for foreseeable economic losses when the parties are in a contractual relationship and does not bar their negligence claim against Heartland.UPDATE (07/25/2013): Five more foreign hackers were charged for their role in stealing information from Heartland Payment Systems, NASDAQ, Dow Jones, JetBlue, and J.C.

The company has notified any customer who used the site from June 3, 2012 through April 30, 2013 that their credit card may have been used fraudulently.  Originally the company was contacted by Discover Card requesting an investigation due to some unauthorized charges experienced by Discover cards customers. The company completed their own investigation and on February 27, 2013 learned that a small number of Visa customers had also experienced unauthorized charges. On March 6, 2013 Mastercard also contacted the company regarding fraudulent charges against their credit card holders.The company hired a forensic investigator who discovered that the company had been a victim of a cyber attack that gained access to and installed malware on their website server in eary June 2012. Their anitvirus and malware scans did not detect the malware. April 3, 2013 the company notified approximately 3,503 customers of the breach. This is the amount that was reported to the company by the credit card companies.  On April 22, 2013, the company received a report from the forensic investigator that 2,598 credit cards were compromised. On April 30, 2013 the company received calls from two customers stating that their cards had been compromised. The company investigated those customers' complaints and reported the issue to the Secret Service. The Secret Service asked the company to not provide any additional notice until their investigation had been completed.The Secret Service investigation uncovered that the hackers had set up an unauthorized email account that captured the company's credit card transactions without their knowledge. The Secret Service could not definitely say who the hacker or hackers were.

Sony placed an outage to block users from playing online games or accessing services like Netflix and Hulu Plus on Friday April 22. Sony says the outage will continue until the situation is addressed, which will likely be within the next week. Sony believes an unauthorized person has obtained names, addresses, email addresses, dates of birth, PlayStation Network/Qriocity password and login, and handle/PSN online IDs for multiple users. The attacker may have also stolen users' purchase history, billing address, and password security questions. User credit card numbers may have also been obtained. Sony has hired a security firm to investigate the incident and strengthen the network infrastructure by re-building their system to provide greater protection of personal information.An individual filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of all PSN users following seven days of a Sony PlayStation Network outage.  The lawsuit alleges that Sony ""failed to encrypt data and establish adequate firewalls to handle a server intrusion contingency, failed to provide prompt and adequate warnings of security breaches, and unreasonably delayed in bringing the PSN service back on line.""  It also accused Sony of violating the Payment Card Industry (PCI) security standard, which prohibits companies from storing cardholder data.UPDATE (5/3/2011): A review of Sony's network breach revealed that it was larger than first thought. Sony turned the SOE system off.  Hackers may have taken personal information from an additional 24,600,000 user accounts in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. Names, addresses, genders, email addresses, login name and associated password, phone numbers and birth dates of SOE gaming customers, as well as data from about 12,700 credit card accounts and 10,700 bank accounts from an outdated 2007 database could have been accessed.  The outdated account information that may have been obtained by hackers includes credit card numbers, debit card numbers, expiration dates, bank account numbers, customer names, account names and customer addresses. The SOE network hosts games that are played over the Internet on personal computers and is separate from the PlayStation network.  Sony has not clearly indicated if credit card numbers were compromised.  At least one report indicates that the numbers were encrypted.  These breached records will not be added to the total until more is known.UPDATE (5/6/2011): Sony now indicates that some credit card numbers were compromised.  Twelve million credit card numbers were unencrypted and could easily be read.UPDATE (5/7/2011): Sony discovered that hackers had placed customer information online. Sony removed the information.  It included customer names and addresses from a 2001 Sony database.Service restoration for the PlayStation network was indefinitely delayed. Additionally, the CEO issued an apology letter.UPDATE (5/17/2011): Hackers began changing user passwords by using PSN account emails and dates of birth within two days of the partial restoration of the PlayStation Network.  Sony failed to alter the password reset system to account for hackers having obtained user email addresses and dates of birth.  Users who changed their passwords, but not the email associated with their PlayStation Network accounts, were vulnerable to the hacker exploit. Sony shut down the PlayStation Network again and released a short statement about the incident.UPDATE (5/23/2011): Sony headquarters expects to spend about $171 million on its personal information theft protection program, welcome back programs, customer support, network security enhancements and legal costs associated with the breach.UPDATE (6/2/2011): Sony fully restored all Playstation Network services in all areas except Japan.  The Playstation Store and Qriocity divisions are now functioning properly.  UPDATE (6/4/2011): A concise history of the Sony hacks can be found here.UPDATE (7/21/2011): Zurich American, one of Sony's insurers, is suing to deny releasing data breach coverage funds to Sony.  Sony expects the breach to lower operating profit by $178 million in the current financial year.  A total of 55 class action complaints have been filed.UPDATE (10/11/2011): Sony Online Entertainment became aware of a large number of unauthorized sign-in attempts.  The attempts took place between October 7 and 10.  About 93,000 PlayStation Network, Sony Entertainment Network, and Sony Online Entertainment services accounts may have been compromised.  The unauthorized parties appear to have verified valid sign-in IDs and passwords after a number of failed attempts.  Sony temporarily locked those accounts. It is unclear if the email addresses were obtained from a previous breach.UPDATE (10/19/2012): A federal judge found that Sony users signed a privacy policy informing them that Sony's security was not perfect.  Sony was cleared of negligence, unjust enrichment, bailment, and violations of California consumer protection statutes. The judge ruled that plaintiffs could not claim that Sony violated consumer-protection laws because PSN services were free of cost.  This dismissed much of the lawsuit.UPDATE (12/16/2013): Sony agreed to drop an insurance claim over litigation related to the 2011 breach.UPDATE (7/30/2014): ""Sony recently offered to settle a class action lawsuit over the 2011 breach of its PlayStation Network.

Experian purchased the assets of Court Ventures in March 2012, and the criminal's access to the US Info Search data was shut down in December 2012. Experian has publicly stated that no Experian databases were breached in this situation.UPDATE (3/10/2014): According to Krebs on Security, in March 2014, Hieu Minh Ngo pled guilty to running an identity theft business called Superget.info out of his home in Vietnam.  Ngo posed as a private investigator when he contracted with Court Ventures to gain access to consumer records. Ngo was then able to provide access to the US Info Search database to his clients.Krebs on Security states, ""The government alleges that the service's customers used the information for a variety of fraud schemes, including filing fraudulent tax returns on Americans, and opening new lines of credit and racking up huge bills in the names of unsuspecting victims. The transcript shows government investigators found that over an 18-month period ending Feb.2013, Ngo's customers made approximately 3.1 million queries on Americans.""Krebs adds, ""That means that if Ngo's clients conducted 3.1 million individual queries, the sheer number of records exposed by Ngo's service is likely to have been many times that number - potentially as many as 30 million records.""More Information: http://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/court-ventures/UPDATE (2/23/2015): The total number of records indicated here has been changed to 3.1 million by PRC to reflect the approximate number of records queried by Ngo's customers according to the court transcript. [This 3/10/14 UPDATE was amended on 2/23/15 to include additional content from the Krebs on Security blog post of March 10, 2014, related to the Court Ventures breach.]UPDATE (7/15/2015): Hieu Minh Ngo, the Vietnamese man who perpetrated an online identity theft service and had access to personal information on more than 200 million Americans was sentenced to 13 years in a U.S prisonUPDATE (7/21/2015): A class action lawsuit has been filed against Experian as a result of their subsidiary, Court Ventures, allowed access to personal information of individuals by one individual who posed as a private invegtigator. ""The suit alleges that Experian negligently violated consumer protection 
laws when it failed to detect for nearly 10 months that a customer of 
its data broker subsidiary was a scammer who ran a criminal service

 data breach victims suffer injury for purposes of Article III standing 
and can thus have their day in court against companies who fail to 
protect their personal information from hackers.  
The class action against Neiman Marcus alleged that the data breach 
plaintiffs suffered injuries even if they have not yet been victims of 
identity theft or other fraud. These injuries include an increased risk 
of future fraudulent charges and greater susceptibility to identity 
theft. Chief Judge Wood noted that “the Neiman Marcus customers should 
not have to wait until hackers commit identity theft or credit-card 
fraud in order to give the class standing, because there is an 
‘objective reasonable likelihood’ that such an injury will occur.” More Information: http://www.ktul.com/story/29599640/data-breach-plaintiffs-have-standing-...",Media,,2014,32.780732,-96.79729499999999,Hacker,Outsider,Online,Network,South,Southwest,10,non_F_regulated,Others,1.3227992150186225,10.0,10,3,20.0,13.0,23.0,7.666666666666667,16.333333333333336

2013-12-13,Target Corp.,Minnesota,HACK,BSR,40000000,"Target discovered that hackers may have accessed customer debit and credit card information during the Thanksgiving and Christmas shopping season.  Customers who used a payment card at any of Target's stores nationwide between November 27, 2013 and December 15, 2013 may have had their payment card information copied for fraudulent purposes.  Credit card companies and banks have been notifying customers of the issue and advising them to watch for suspicious charges.  Customer names, credit or debit card numbers, card expiration dates, and card security codes were taken and have appeared on the black market.UPDATE (12/24/2013): Target now faces at least three class-action lawsuits as a result of the breach.  A wave of scam artists are attempting to profit from the breach by posing as Target or bank representatives addressing the breach.  People who shopped at Target are being warned not to give their information out over the phone.  Target is working with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Secret Service to investigate the breach.UPDATE (12/27/2013): Target customers are also being warned to be suspicious of emails claiming to be from Target or banks that request personal information.  It is estimated that the breach may cost Target up to $3.6 billion.  It appears that online customers were not affected.UPDATE (12/28/2013): Target confirmed that PINs associated with payment cards were also exposed.UPDATE (1/2/2014): East-West bank has issued a letter to their card holders warning that some of their accounts may have been compromised due to the Target data breach. East-West bank has issued new credit cards to their customers who shopped at any Target stores to reduce any potential unauthorized use of a card. (Source CA Attorney Generals' Office)UPDATE (1/10/2014): Target Corp. says that up to 70 million people were affected by the data breach, significantly more than was originally suspected. Experts predict the numbers could climb even higher than 70 million once the company completes its investigation. UPDATE (1/13/2014): Target Corp. has confirmed that malware was found on the Point of Sale devices. The malware has been removed. The number of individuals affected are now said to be 110 million individuals, 70 million more than originally thought.UPDATE (1/13/2014): Security experts are stating that Target may not be alone in the data breach. Neiman Marcus and at least 3 other unnamed retailers (these retailers are thought to be located in Eastern Europe) may also have been compromised as federal investigators track what they believe to be an international crime ring. UPDATE (1/14/2014): Companies that help Target process payments could be facing millions of dollars in fines and costs as a result of the data breach.UPDATE (1/16/2014): The malware that infected in the Target POS systems has been found and is known as the Trojan.POSRAM, according to new report by investigators. ""The malware is a memory-scraping tool that grabs card data directly from point-of-sale terminals and then stores it on the victims system for later retrieval"". The malware was originally thought to have been developed in Russia, known as BlackPOS. This new version is considered to be highly customized so that current anitvirus programs would not have detected it as reported by investigative agencies.UPDATE (1/20/2014): ""A 17 year-old Russian national from St. Petersburg is thought to be responsible for the malicious programming that allowed for data from Target and Neiman Marcus to be compromised,"" according to a California based security firm.UPDATE (1/21/2014): Two Mexican citizens were arrested at the border in South Texas for the purchase of thousands of dollars worth of merchandise with information stolen during the Target security breach, as reported by a South Texas police chief.A spokesman with the Secret Service announced that the investigation is ongoing into the possibility of a link between the Target breach and the two arrested in Texas. UPDATE (1/29/2014): The malware used in the Target attack could suggest a poorly secured feature built into a popular IT management software product that was running on the retailers internal newtork.UPDATE (1/29/2014):  A Target Corp. investor filed suit in Minnesota federal court Wednesday, against the retailers Executives holding them liable for damage caused by the holiday season data breach that saw hackers steal personal and financial information from tens of millions of customers.Shareholder Maureen Collier filed the suite with a complaint alleging that Target's board and top executives harmed the company financially by failing to take adequate steps to prevent the cyberattack then by subsequently providing customers with incomplete and misleading information about the extent of the data theft.""The suit brings claims of breach of fiduciary duty, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets and abuse of control, and seeks monetary damages on behalf of the company from the 14 named officers and directors"".UPDATE (2/5/2014): Hackers who broke into Target's computer network and stole customers'
 financial and personal data used credentials alledgedly  were stolen from a 
heating and air conditioning subcontractor in Pennsylvania, according to
 digital security journalist Brian Krebs.It appears as though the air conditioning company was given access to Target's 
computer network in order for the vendor to make remote changes to the system to  cut heating and cooling costs. Target has not confirmed the accuracy of this report.UPDATE (2/6/2014): Target Corporation announced they are fast tracking new credit card security technology in their stores, 6 months earlier than originally planned. Target's CFO announced it is moving up its goal to utilize chip-enabled smart cards, 
and now plans to have them in stores by early 2015. These cards encrypt point of sale data,
 rendering the credit card number less useful if stolen. Currently this technology is more prevalent outide of the US, but have resulted in 
lower card number thefts in other countries, notably Canada and the 
United Kingdom.UPDATE (2/15/2014): The breach at the Target Copr. that exposed credit card and personal data on more than 110 million consumers appears to have begun with a malware-laced email phishing attack sent to employees at the HVAC contractor Fazio Mechanical in Sharpsburg Pennsylvania. According to Krebs on Security, ""multiple sources close to the investigation now tell this reporter that those credentials were stolen in an email malware attack at Fazio that began at least two months before thieves started stealing card data from thousands of Target cash registers.""UPDATE (5/5/2014): Target's CEO has resigned in the wake of the data breach over the holiday season. He is claiming the breach was his fault. He is the second major executive to resign. Earlier in the year the company's Chief Technology Office resigned as well. The CFO of the company will take over as the interim CEO.UPDATE (8/7/2014): Target has announced that the data breach will cost it's shareholders $148 million. UPDATE (12/9/2014): A Minnesota ruled that a lawsuit put forth by several banks could proceed as the court stated that Target failed to adequately defend against the massive data breach they suffered. This is the first time a data breach case of this size has moved forward based on a companies failure to respond to warnings from security software/experts.

Washington Heights, Manhattan, whose mental health needs were being 
assessed.It was a hack with different fingers, infiltrating two

The cybersecurity breach at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency was detected in September while the agency was undertaking a retrospective two-year review of employees downloading information in an effort to help minimize cyberthreats. The breach, flagged to Congress and three other government agencies including the Department of Homeland Security, occurred in November 2015 when a former employee downloaded a large number of files onto two thumb drives before retiring from the agency. The OCC said data on the thumb drives were encrypted and there is no evidence that data taken by the employee were “disclosed” or “misused.”An OCC spokesman said the files included information “related to OCC activities and employees.” He said there is “no indication that there was bank customer information among the files removed.”The agency said that once it discovered the data breach, it immediately referred the case to the Treasury Department’s Inspector General’s office. The OCC review concluded it was a “major incident,” involving more than 10,000 records and potentially exposing personal information. The former employee was identified only as a retiree who downloaded the information shortly before leaving the agency. Government agencies are required to report all “major incidents” to Congress; this is the first time the OCC has done so.

2016-11-20,IRS,District Of Columbia,INSD,GOV,28200000,"""A recent report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) found that IRS employees sent unencrypted emails which contained 8,031 different taxpayers’ personally identifiable information. According to the report, TIGTA found 326 unencrypted emails containing taxpayer data. 275 of the emails were sent internally within IRS, while 51 emails were sent outside of the agency’s network to non-IRS email accounts. Of those emails sent externally, 20 were sent to six IRS employees’ personal email accounts. The significance of where the emails were sent is relevant to the level of the security risk to the taxpayer data. The report noted that unencrypted emails sent within the IRS internal network were of lower risk because they remained behind the agency’s firewalls which greatly lowers the probability they could be accessed by a third party. However, the emails sent outside of the agency were exposed to greater risk, not only because they were not encrypted, but because they no longer had the protection afforded by the firewall. Additionally, for the emails sent to personal accounts, the report noted that per IRS policy, no officer or employee of the IRS may use a personal email account to conduct official business. 326 emails containing 8,031 different taxpayers’ data may not sound like much, but TIGTA had this to say about their findings"" - See more at: http://www.fedsmith.com/2016/11/20/ig-irs-employees-sent-unencrypted-ema...More information: http://www.fedsmith.com/2016/11/20/ig-irs-employees-sent-unencrypted-ema...",Media,,2016,38.907191999999995,-77.03687099999999,Others,Insider,Others,Others,Non_US,Non_US,0,non_F_regulated,Others,33.91176169411378,10.0,7,1,17.0,11.0,18.0,6.0,21.0

When the campus detected a vulnerability in one of these areas in November, the campus began installing and testing a security fix — known as a patch — which can take weeks, Rivers said during the press call. During this process, attackers were able to discover a security flaw and gained access to the system.BFS contains the information of about 50 percent of current students and 65 percent of active employees. Affected individuals largely include students, faculty and staff who received payments from the campus, mainly through electronic fund transfers. Those who received paper payments, however, may have also been affected.A private computer investigation firm was retained by the campus to further determine whether personal information was compromised. The campus will send notice letters in the mail with more information about free credit monitoring and insurance to those who were potentially impacted starting Friday.According to Rivers, this is the third significant breach UC Berkeley has seen in the past five years.Within a day of the unauthorized intrusion Dec. 28, the campus’s security team had detected and began efforts to contain the attack, according to campus spokesperson Janet Gilmore.Once campus IT staff identified the unauthorized access, they forensically preserved copies of the system for investigation purposes and took affected servers offline for about two weeks to prevent further access.

 email and password combinations were stolen by hackers. At the time, 
LinkedIn issued a mandatory password reset for any accounts they thought
 were compromised; all LinkedIn members were encouraged to change their 
passwords as well, just in case.
Fast forward to present day, and the 2012 breach has come back to 
haunt LinkedIn. The stolen data popped up online, and in an e-mail to 
LinkedIn users sent on May 25, 2016, the company said the published 
information included email addresses, hashed passwords, and LinkedIn 
member IDs, which are an internal identifier LinkedIn assigns to each 
member profile. They immediately invalidated passwords of all LinkedIn 
accounts that were created prior to the 2012 breach and had not 
undergone a password reset since the breach.
LinkedIn’s attempts to protect users, however, are extending beyond 
resetting passwords this time. They are also using automated tools to 
try and identify (and block) any suspicious activity on specific 
LinkedIn accounts. The proper authorities have been contacted and 
LinkedIn is working with law enforcement. They have demanded that anyone
 making stolen password data available must stop immediately, or face 
potential legal action.
In their e-mail, the company also shared that they have improved 
security features since the 2012 breach, which will hopefully prevent 
another incident like this from happening in the future. As examples, 
they noted that they use salted hashes to store passwords and offer two-step verification
 for members who are interested in additional security. LinkedIn also 
encouraged members to use strong passwords and to change them regularly.
 If you don’t change your password often enough because you have trouble
 remembering new passwords, consider using a password manager, which can help you keep all of your passwords organized.""More information: https://www.identityforce.com/blog/linkedin-data-breach-continues-cause-...",Media,,2016,37.386052,-122.083851,Hacker,Outsider,Online,Network,West,West,16,non_F_regulated,Others,140.6977346883444,10.0,10,6,20.0,16.0,26.0,8.666666666666666,5.333333333333334
2016-05-13,Tumblr,New York,HACK,BSO,65469300,"""A third party accessed a set of Tumblr user email addresses with salted and hashed passwords, the Yahoo-owned microblogging site said Thursday.
The credentials are from early 2013, prior to Tumblr's acquisition by Yahoo, officials said in a May 12 blog post.  
The site's security team investigated the matter as soon as it became aware of the incident.
“Our analysis gives us no reason to believe that this information was used to access Tumblr accounts,” the blog said. 
Officials said in the blog that those affected will be required to 
set a new password as a precaution. Users are instructed to visit the 
sites security page for more information on how to keep their accounts 
secure.""More information: https://www.scmagazine.com/tumblr-announces-email-credentials-compromise...UPDATE (5/31/2016):  ""More than 65 million Tumblr accounts from a 2013 breach were spotted for sale on the dark web. 
Security researcher and Haveibeenpwned
 owner Troy Hunt recently found a database containing the stolen account
 information for sale on a dark web market site and listed the breach on
 his own site as the third largest ever.
A hacker known as Peace was selling the database for $150, according to Vice's Motherboard.
 Peace told Motherboard the price is so low because the salted passwords
 are very difficult to crack however, Hunt told the publication roughly 
half of the passwords will likely be cracked due to weak password 
protections that were used at the time. 
On May 12, Tumblr notified
 users of the breach that compromised user email addresses with salted 
and hashed passwords from early 2013 and told users there is no reason 
to believe that the information was used to access their Tumblr 
accounts.
Although the breach isn't as bad as other major breaches, it has the 
potential to be dangerous for users who re-use passwords, Kaspersky Lab 
Senior Security Researcher Brian Bartholomew told SCMagazine.com via 
email. 
“If you were to think about how many users from Tumblr have Apple 
cloud accounts, Twitter accounts, Gmail or other online mail accounts, 
etc. the potential risk is high for this breach to bleed over into other
 stories down the road,” he said.  “These credentials could be used by 
criminals to access anything from bank accounts, to mail accounts, to 
other online systems that may house personal data / pictures / etc.”
Bartholomew also said the credentials could be used to carry out phishing attacks, targeting and extortion.""More information: https://www.scmagazine.com/tumblr-accounts-from-2013-breach-for-sale-on-...",Media,,2016,40.712784,-74.005941,Hacker,Outsider,Online,Network,Northeast,Northeast,14,non_F_regulated,Others,78.72976240710791,10.0,10,6,20.0,16.0,26.0,8.666666666666666,5.333333333333334

Subsequent investigations led officials to believe the devices were stolen, and police were notified, according to Sharp.
“The devices were used to process and store patient-specific wellness

2017-03-15,Dunn and Bradstreet,New York,DISC,BSO,33500000," 	 	 	 	 	""NEW YORK -- Millions of records from a commercial corporate database have been leaked. 	 	 	 	 	The database, about 52 gigabytes in size, contains just under 33.7 million unique email addresses and other contact information from employees of thousands of companies, representing a large portion of the US corporate population. 	 	 	 	 	Dun & Bradstreet, a business services giant, confirmed that it owns the database, which it acquired as part  	of a 2015 deal to buy NetProspex for $125 million.The purchased database contains dozens of fields, some including personal information such as names, job titles and functions, work email addresses, and phone numbers. 	 	 	 	 	Other information includes more generic corporate and publicly sourced data, such as believed office location, the number of employees in the business unit, and other descriptions of the kind of industry the company falls into, such as advertising, legal,  media and broadcasting, and telecoms. 	 	 	 	 	This entire database is used for marketers who want to directly target their own email campaigns and through other communications methods for current and prospective customers. 	 	 	 	 	The data can be bought either in bulk, or by type of record by companies, but it's not known exactly how much the going rate is for a full data set of this size. We understand from  	a 2015 brochure that the cost of accessing a half-million records can cost some firms up to $200,000. 	 	 	 	 	Troy Hunt, who runs breach notification site  	Have I Been Pwned, obtained the database and analyzed the records. 	 	 	 	 	In  	a blog post Tuesday, Hunt said the breakdown was entirely US-focused, with California as the most represented demographic with over four million records, then New York with 2.7 million records and Texas with 2.6 million records. 	 	 	 	 	Hunt's analysis of the records showed that the leading organization by records is the Dept. of Defense, with 101,013 employee records, followed closely by the US Postal Service with 88,153 employee records. 	 	 	 	 	The US Army, Air Force, and Dept. of Veterans Affairs are all listed with a combined 76,379 records. 	 	 	 	 	AT&T, Boeing, Dell, FedEx, IBM, and Xerox were among the most named companies in the database, with tens of thousands of employee records each. 	 	 	 	 	""Whilst you could piece together parts of the data from information already in the public domain, having it aggregated and so easily searchable in this fashion is enormously valuable,"" said Hunt in an email on Tuesday. ""It also serves as a reminder that we've lost control of our privacy; the vast majority of people in the data set would have no idea their information is being sold in this fashion and they certainly don't have any control over it."" 	 	 	 	 	Hunt ran the exposed database through  	Have I Been Pwned's database of breached records, which showed 14 percent of email addresses already existed in his database. 	 	 	 	 	The data is now searchable in  	Have I Been Pwned. 	 	 	 	 	But it's not known exactly how the data was exposed, or who is to blame for the leak.  	 	 	 	 	A spokesperson for Dun & Bradshaw would not talk on the record beyond an emailed statement, sent prior to publication. 	 	 	 	 	""We've carefully evaluated the information that was shared with us and it is of a type and in a format that we deliver to customers every day.

2010-04-14,"Affinity Health Plan, Inc.",New York,PHYS,MED,344579,"Under a settlement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Affinity Health Plan, Inc. will settle potential violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules for $1,215,780. Affinity Health Plan is a not-for-profit managed care plan serving the New York metropolitan area.
\Affinity filed a breach report with the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) on April 15, 2010, as required by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health, or HITECH Act. The HITECH Breach Notification Rule requires HIPAA-covered entities to notify HHS of a breach of unsecured protected health information. Affinity indicated that it was informed by a representative of CBS Evening News that, as part of an investigatory report, CBS had purchased a photocopier previously leased by Affinity. CBS informed Affinity that the copier that Affinity had used contained confidential medical information on the hard drive.
\Affinity estimated that up to 344,579 individuals may have been affected by this breach. OCR's investigation indicated that Affinity impermissibly disclosed the protected health information of these affected individuals when it returned multiple photocopiers to leasing agents without erasing the data contained on the copier hard drives. In addition, the investigation revealed that Affinity failed to incorporate the electronic protected health information (ePHI) stored on photocopier hard drives in its analysis of risks and vulnerabilities as required by the Security Rule, and failed to implement policies and procedures when returning the photocopiers to its leasing agents.
\This settlement illustrates an important reminder about equipment designed to retain electronic information: Make sure that all personal information is wiped from hardware before it's recycled, thrown away or sent back to a leasing agent, said OCR Director Leon Rodriguez. 'HIPAA covered entities are required to undertake a careful risk analysis to understand the threats and vulnerabilities to individuals' data, and have appropriate safeguards in place to protect this information.'
\In addition to the $1,215,780 payment, the settlement includes a corrective action plan requiring Affinity to use its best efforts to retrieve all hard drives that were contained on photocopiers previously leased by the plan that remain in the possession of the leasing agent, and to take certain measures to safeguard all ePHI.

2010-07-02,Centerstone,Tennessee,PHYS,MED,1537,"A major flooding event damaged a building where the CE operated its school-based program offices.  The flooding was so significant that the area was deemed a federal disaster area.  An estimated 1,537 individuals were affected by the loss of data due to flood damage.  The types of PHI involved were names, addresses, dates of birth, and social security numbers.  After the flood, the CE attempted to collect as much PHI as it could from the site but access was limited by authorities because the building was deemed toxic and salvage cleanup commenced prior to the CE's ability to access the building.  PHI in paper format was either washed away or disposed of during salvage procedures.  Computers and equipment in the building were destroyed by water damage.  Because the CE relied primarily on their electronic health records stored on an offsite server, medical data was still intact for continuity of care purposes.  The CE provided breach notification to individuals, HHS, and the media, and posted substitute notice on its website.  The CE has since moved its school-based operations to a CE owned facility.  OCR obtained assurances that the CE implemented the corrective action listed above.

2010-09-24,NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University Medical Center,New York,PHYS,MED,6800,"Data breach results in $4.8 million HIPAA settlements
\Two health care organizations have agreed to settle charges that they potentially violated the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules by failing to secure thousands of patients' electronic protected health information (ePHI) held on their network. The monetary payments of $4,800,000 include the largest HIPAA settlement to date.
\The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) initiated its investigation of New York and Presbyterian Hospital (NYP) and Columbia University (CU) following their submission of a joint breach report, dated September 27, 2010, regarding the disclosure of the ePHI of 6,800 individuals, including patient status, vital signs, medications, and laboratory results.
\NYP and CU are separate covered entities that participate in a joint arrangement in which CU faculty members serve as attending physicians at NYP. The entities generally refer to their affiliation as 'New York Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center.' NYP and CU operate a shared data network and a shared network firewall that is administered by employees of both entities. The shared network links to NYP patient information systems containing ePHI.
\The investigation revealed that the breach was caused when a physician employed by CU who developed applications for both NYP and CU attempted to deactivate a personally-owned computer server on the network containing NYP patient ePHI. Because of a lack of technical safeguards, deactivation of the server resulted in ePHI being accessible on internet search engines. The entities learned of the breach after receiving a complaint by an individual who found the ePHI of the individual's deceased partner, a former patient of NYP, on the internet.
\In addition to the impermissible disclosure of ePHI on the internet, OCR's investigation found that neither NYP nor CU made efforts prior to the breach to assure that the server was secure and that it contained appropriate software protections. Moreover, OCR determined that neither entity had conducted an accurate and thorough risk analysis that identified all systems that access NYP ePHI. As a result, neither entity had developed an adequate risk management plan that addressed the potential threats and hazards to the security of ePHI. Lastly, NYP failed to implement appropriate policies and procedures for authorizing access to its databases and failed to comply with its own policies on information access management.
\'When entities participate in joint compliance arrangements, they share the burden of addressing the risks to protected health information,' said Christina Heide, Acting Deputy Director of Health Information Privacy for OCR. 'Our cases against NYP and CU should remind health care organizations of the need to make data security central to how they manage their information systems.'
\NYP has paid OCR a monetary settlement of $3,300,000 and CU $1,500,000, with both entities agreeing to a substantive corrective action plan, which includes undertaking a risk analysis, developing a risk management plan, revising policies and procedures, training staff, and providing progress reports.

As a result of this incident, the CE convened a high level work group to oversee privacy and security issues and hired an expert forensic investigator to perform a risk assessment.  The CE updated its privacy and security policies and procedures, developed a plan to adopt electronic health records and initiated a continuous review process including random HIPAA compliance audits.  The CE also expanded its HIPAA training program for employees.  OCR obtained written assurances that the CE implemented the corrective action listed above.

2010-11-18,"Triple-S Salud, Inc.",Puerto Rico,PHYS,MED,398000,"Triple-S Management Corporation (“TRIPLE-S”), on behalf of its wholly owned subsidiaries, Triple-S Salud Inc., Triple-C Inc. and Triple-S Advantage Inc. , formerly known as American Health Medicare Inc.,  has agreed to settle potential violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights (OCR).  TRIPLE-S will pay $3.5 million and will adopt a robust corrective action plan to correct deficiencies in its HIPAA compliance program, an effort it has already begun.
“OCR remains committed to strong enforcement of the HIPAA Rules,” said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels. “This case sends an important message for HIPAA Covered Entities not only about compliance with the requirements of the Security Rule, including risk analysis, but compliance with the requirements of the Privacy Rule, including those addressing business associate agreements and the minimum necessary use of protected health information.”
TRIPLE-S is an insurance holding company based in San Juan, Puerto Rico, which offers a wide range of insurance products and services to residents of Puerto Rico through its subsidiaries.  TRIPLE-S has fully cooperated with HHS in investigating this case and has agreed to put in place a comprehensive HIPAA compliance program as a condition for settlement.  
After receiving multiple breach notifications from TRIPLE-S involving unsecured protected health information (PHI), OCR initiated investigations to ascertain the entities’ compliance with HIPAA Rules. OCR’s investigations indicated widespread non-compliance throughout the various subsidiaries of Triple-S, including:
Failure to implement appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the privacy of its beneficiaries’ PHI;
Impermissible disclosure of its beneficiaries’ PHI to an outside vendor with which it did not have an appropriate business associate agreement;
Use or Disclosure of more PHI than was necessary to carry out mailings;
Failure to conduct an accurate and thorough risk analysis that incorporates all IT equipment, applications, and data systems utilizing ePHI; and
Failure to implement security measures sufficient to reduce the risks and vulnerabilities to its ePHI to a reasonable and appropriate level.
The settlement requires TRIPLE-S to establish a comprehensive compliance program designed to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the personal information it collects from its beneficiaries, that includes:
A risk analysis and a risk management plan;
A process to evaluate and address any environmental or operational changes that affect the security of the ePHI it holds;
Policies and procedures to facilitate compliance with requirements of the HIPAA Rules; and
A training program covering the requirements of the Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules, intended to be used for all members of the workforce and business associates providing services on TRIPLE-S premises.
Triple-S, with the help of OCR through its technical assistance, had already begun to take extensive corrective action, as required by the Corrective Action Plan, and will continue to work with OCR to come into compliance with HIPAA.
“Triple-S is committed to protecting the privacy and security of its beneficiaries’ health information and implementing the Corrective Action Plan entered into with OCR,” said President and CEO of Triple-S Management Corporation, Ramon M. Ruiz.  “We are pleased with the agreement and regard it as an opportunity to strengthen our privacy policies. We have appreciated OCR’s technical assistance to date, and look forward to our collaboration in the future.”

In addition, the BA retrained all employees regarding its security policies.  The CE terminated its BA agreement with the BA.  The breach incident involved a BA and occurred prior to the September 23, 2013, compliance date.

2010-12-13,Hospital Auxilio Mutuo,Puerto Rico,PHYS,MED,1000,"The covered entity (CE), Hospital Auxilio Mutuo de Puerto Rico, Inc., reported that on November 9, 2010, an employee resigned his position and removed two computer hard drives and a laptop computer that contained electronic protected health information (ePHI), potentially affecting over 30,000 individuals.  The CE initially reported that the breached ePHI included names, addresses, zip codes, dates of births, social security numbers, diagnostic conditions and other treatment information.  During the investigation, the CE retrieved the hard drives and laptop and determined that the hard drives contained confidential financial information and business making decisions by the CE, and did not include the types of identifiers (e.g. patient names, Social Security numbers, home addresses, etc.) that could be used to re-identify an individual.  Thus, the CE determined that the theft did not constitute a breach of ePHI.  Further, the CE determined that the laptop was an information technology department laptop that only contained financial data and upper management e-mails.  As of the result of OCR’s investigation, OCR has required the CE to conduct a risk analysis, implement a risk management plan, revise its policies and procedures, and re-train its staff.

2011-09-27,North Memorial Health Care,Minnesota,PHYS,MED,9497,"North Memorial Health Care of Minnesota has agreed to pay $1,550,000 to settle charges that it potentially violated the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules by failing to enter into a business associate agreement with a major contractor and failing to institute an organization-wide risk analysis to address the risks and vulnerabilities to its patient information. North Memorial is a comprehensive, not-for-profit health care system in Minnesota that serves the Twin Cities and surrounding communities.
“Two major cornerstones of the HIPAA Rules were overlooked by this entity,” said Jocelyn Samuels, Director of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR). “Organizations must have in place compliant business associate agreements as well as an accurate and thorough risk analysis that addresses their enterprise-wide IT infrastructure.”
OCR initiated its investigation of North Memorial following receipt of a breach report on September 27, 2011, which indicated that an unencrypted, password-protected laptop was stolen from a business associate’s workforce member’s locked vehicle, impacting the electronic protected health information (ePHI) of 9,497 individuals.
OCR’s investigation indicated that North Memorial failed to have in place a business associate agreement, as required under the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules, so that its business associate could perform certain payment and health care operations activities on its behalf. North Memorial gave its business associate, Accretive Health, Inc., access to North Memorial’s hospital database, which stored the ePHI of 289,904 patients. Accretive also received access to non-electronic protected health information as it performed services on-site at North Memorial.
The investigation further determined that North Memorial failed to complete a risk analysis to address all of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the ePHI that it maintained, accessed, or transmitted across its entire IT infrastructure -- including but not limited to all applications, software, databases, servers, workstations, mobile devices and electronic media, network administration and security devices, and associated business processes.
In addition to the $1,550,000 payment, North Memorial is required to develop an organization-wide risk analysis and risk management plan, as required under the Security Rule. North Memorial will also train appropriate workforce members on all policies and procedures newly developed or revised pursuant to this corrective action plan.

2011-09-29,MAPFRE Life,Massachusetts,PHYS,MED,2209,"HIPAA settlement demonstrates importance of implementing safeguards for ePHI
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights (OCR), has announced a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) settlement based on the impermissible disclosure of unsecured electronic protected health information (ePHI).  MAPFRE Life Insurance Company of Puerto Rico (MAPFRE) has agreed to settle potential noncompliance with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules by paying $2.2 million and implementing a corrective action plan. With this resolution amount, OCR balanced potential violations of the HIPAA Rules with evidence provided by MAPFRE with regard to its present financial standing.  MAPFRE is a subsidiary company of MAPFRE S.A., a global multinational insurance company headquartered in Spain. MAPFRE underwrites and administers a variety of insurance products and services in Puerto Rico, including personal and group health insurance plans.
On September 29, 2011, MAPFRE filed a breach report with OCR indicating that a USB data storage device (described as a “pen drive”) containing ePHI was stolen from its IT department, where the device was left without safeguards overnight.   According to the report, the USB data storage device included complete names, dates of birth and Social Security numbers.   The report noted that the breach affected 2,209 individuals.   MAPFRE informed OCR that it was able to identify the breached ePHI by reconstituting the data on the computer on which the USB data storage device was attached. OCR’s investigation revealed MAPFRE’s noncompliance with the HIPAA Rules, specifically a failure to conduct its risk analysis and implement risk management plans, contrary to its prior representations, and a failure to deploy encryption or an equivalent alternative measure on its laptops and removable storage media until September 1, 2014.  MAPFRE also failed to implement or delayed implementing other corrective measures it informed OCR it would undertake.
“Covered entities must not only make assessments to safeguard ePHI, they must act on those assessments as well” said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels. “OCR works tirelessly and collaboratively with covered entities to set clear expectations and consequences.”

APDerm will also be required to implement a corrective action plan to correct deficiencies in its HIPAA compliance program.  APDerm is a private practice that delivers dermatology services in four locations in Massachusetts and two in New Hampshire. This case marks the first settlement with a covered entity for not having policies and procedures in place to address the breach notification provisions of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, passed as part of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA).
\
\The HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) opened an investigation of APDerm upon receiving a report that an unencrypted thumb drive containing the electronic protected health information (ePHI) of approximately 2,200 individuals was stolen from a vehicle of one its staff members. The thumb drive was never recovered.  The investigation revealed that APDerm had not conducted an accurate and thorough analysis of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality of ePHI as part of its security management process.  Further, APDerm did not fully comply with requirements of the Breach Notification Rule to have in place written policies and procedures and train workforce members.
\
\'As we say in health care, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,' said OCR Director Leon Rodriguez. 'That is what a good risk management process is all about ' identifying and mitigating the risk before a bad thing happens.  Covered entities of all sizes need to give priority to securing electronic protected health information.'
\
\In addition to a $150,000 resolution amount, the settlement includes a corrective action plan requiring AP Derm to develop a risk analysis and risk management plan to address and mitigate any security risks and vulnerabilities, as well as to provide an implementation report to OCR.

Lahey will pay $850,000 and will adopt a robust corrective action plan to correct deficiencies in its HIPAA compliance program.  Lahey is a nonprofit teaching hospital affiliated with Tufts Medical School, providing primary and specialty care in Burlington, Massachusetts.
Lahey notified OCR that a laptop was stolen from an unlocked treatment room during the overnight hours on August 11, 2011.  The laptop was on a stand that accompanied a portable CT scanner; the laptop operated the scanner and produced images for viewing through Lahey’s Radiology Information System and Picture Archiving and Communication System.  The laptop hard drive contained the protected health information (PHI) of 599 individuals.  Evidence obtained through OCR’s subsequent investigation indicated widespread non-compliance with the HIPAA rules, including:
•Failure to conduct a thorough risk analysis of all of its ePHI;
•Failure to physically safeguard a workstation that accessed ePHI;
•Failure to implement and maintain policies and procedures regarding the safeguarding of ePHI maintained on workstations utilized in connection with diagnostic/laboratory equipment;
•Lack of a unique user name for identifying and tracking user identity with respect to the workstation at issue in this incident;
•Failure to implement procedures that recorded and examined activity in the workstation at issue in this incident; and
•Impermissible disclosure of 599 individuals’ PHI.
“It is essential that covered entities apply appropriate protections to workstations associated with medical devices such as diagnostic or laboratory equipment,” said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels. “Because these workstations often contain ePHI and are highly portable, such ePHI must be considered during an entity’s risk analysis, and entities must ensure that necessary safeguards that conform to HIPAA’s standards are in place.”
In addition to the $850,000 settlement, Lahey must address its history of noncompliance with the HIPAA Rules by providing OCR with a comprehensive, enterprise-wide risk analysis and corresponding risk management plan, as well as reporting certain events and providing evidence of compliance.

2012-01-27,Metro Community Provider Network,Colorado,HACK,MED,3200,"The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights (OCR), has announced a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) settlement based on the lack of a security management process to safeguard electronic protected health information (ePHI). Metro Community Provider Network (MCPN), a federally-qualified health center (FQHC), has agreed to settle potential noncompliance with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules by paying $400,000 and implementing a corrective action plan. With this settlement amount, OCR considered MCPN’s status as a FQHC when balancing the significance of the violation with MCPN’s ability to maintain sufficient financial standing to ensure the provision of ongoing patient care. MCPN provides primary medical care, dental care, pharmacies, social work, and behavioral health care services throughout the greater Denver, Colorado metropolitan area to approximately 43,000 patients per year, a large majority of whom have incomes at or below the poverty level.
On January 27, 2012, MCPN filed a breach report with OCR indicating that a hacker accessed employees' email accounts and obtained 3,200 individuals' ePHI through a phishing incident. OCR’s investigation revealed that MCPN took necessary corrective action related to the phishing incident; however, the investigation also revealed that MCPN failed to conduct a risk analysis until mid-February 2012. Prior to the breach incident, MCPN had not conducted a risk analysis to assess the risks and vulnerabilities in its ePHI environment, and, consequently, had not implemented any corresponding risk management plans to address the risks and vulnerabilities identified in a risk analysis. When MCPN finally conducted a risk analysis, that risk analysis, as well as all subsequent risk analyses, were insufficient to meet the requirements of the Security Rule.
“Patients seeking health care trust that their providers will safeguard and protect their health information,” said OCR Director Roger Severino. “Compliance with the HIPAA Security Rule helps covered entities meet this important obligation to their patient communities.”

2012-03-03,Anchorage Community Mental Health Services Inc.,Alaska,DISC,MED,2743,"Anchorage Community Mental Health Services (ACMHS) has agreed to settle potential violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Security Rule with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office for Civil Rights (OCR). ACMHS will pay $150,000 and adopt a corrective action plan to correct deficiencies in its HIPAA compliance program. ACMHS is a five-facility, nonprofit organization providing behavioral health care services to children, adults, and families in Anchorage, Alaska. 
OCR opened an investigation after receiving notification from ACMHS regarding a breach of unsecured electronic protected health information (ePHI) affecting 2,743 individuals due to malware compromising the security of its information technology resources. OCR’s investigation revealed that ACMHS had adopted sample Security Rule policies and procedures in 2005, but these were not followed. Moreover, the security incident was the direct result of ACMHS failing to identify and address basic risks, such as not regularly updating their IT resources with available patches and running outdated, unsupported software. 
“Successful HIPAA compliance requires a common sense approach to assessing and addressing the risks to ePHI on a regular basis,” said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels. “This includes reviewing systems for unpatched vulnerabilities and unsupported software that can leave patient information susceptible to malware and other risks.” 
ACMHS cooperated with OCR throughout its investigation and has been responsive to technical assistance provided to date. In addition to the $150,000 settlement amount, the agreement includes a corrective action plan and requires ACMHS to report on the state of its compliance to OCR for a two-year period. The Resolution Agreement can be found on the OCR website at http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/enforcement/examples/index.html

2012-08-28,"Cancer Care Group, P.C.",Indiana,PHYS,MED,55000,"$750,000 HIPAA settlement emphasizes the importance of risk analysis and device and media control policies
Cancer Care Group, P.C. agreed to settle potential violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office for Civil Rights (OCR). Cancer Care paid $750,000 and will adopt a robust corrective action plan to correct deficiencies in its HIPAA compliance program. Cancer Care Group is a radiation oncology private physician practice, with 13 radiation oncologists serving hospitals and clinics throughout Indiana.
On August 29, 2012, OCR received notification from Cancer Care regarding a breach of unsecured electronic protected health information (ePHI) after a laptop bag was stolen from an employee’s car. The bag contained the employee’s computer and unencrypted backup media, which contained the names, addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, insurance information and clinical information of approximately 55,000 current and former Cancer Care patients.
OCR’s subsequent investigation found that, prior to the breach, Cancer Care was in widespread non-compliance with the HIPAA Security Rule. It had not conducted an enterprise-wide risk analysis when the breach occurred in July 2012. Further, Cancer Care did not have in place a written policy specific to the removal of hardware and electronic media containing ePHI into and out of its facilities, even though this was common practice within the organization. OCR found that these two issues, in particular, contributed to the breach, as an enterprise-wide risk analysis could have identified the removal of unencrypted backup media as an area of significant risk to Cancer Care’s ePHI, and a comprehensive device and media control policy could have provided employees with direction in regard to their responsibilities when removing devices containing ePHI from the facility.
“Organizations must complete a comprehensive risk analysis and establish strong policies and procedures to protect patients’ health information,” said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels. “Further, proper encryption of mobile devices and electronic media reduces the likelihood of a breach of protected health information.”
Cancer Care has taken corrective action with regard to the specific requirements of the Privacy and Security Rules that are at the core of this enforcement action, as well as actions to come into compliance with the other provisions of the HIPAA Rules. The Resolution Agreement and Corrective Action Plan (CAP) can be found on the OCR website at: http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/enforcement/examples/cancercare.html

2012-09-14,The Feinstein Institute for Medical Reserch,New York,PHYS,MED,13000,"Feinstein Institute for Medical Research (Feinstein) has agreed to settle potential violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights (OCR). Feinstein will pay $3.9 million and will adopt a robust corrective action plan to correct deficiencies in its HIPAA compliance program; an effort it has already begun.
Research institutions subject to HIPAA must be held to the same compliance standards as all other HIPAA-covered entities,” said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels.  “For individuals to trust in the research process and for patients to trust in those institutions, they must have some assurance that their information is kept private and secure.”  
Feinstein is a biomedical research institute that is organized as a New York not-for-profit corporation and is sponsored by Northwell Health, Inc., formerly known as North Shore Long Island Jewish Health System, a large health system headquartered in Manhasset, New York that is comprised of twenty one hospitals and over 450 patient facilities and physician practices.
After receiving a breach notification from Feinstein involving unsecured electronic protected health information (ePHI), OCR initiated an investigation to ascertain the entity’s compliance with HIPAA Rules. OCR’s investigation indicated that the following occurred:
•	Feinstein impermissibly disclosed the ePHI of 13,000 individuals when an Feinstein-owned laptop computer containing ePHI was left unsecured in the back seat of an employee’s car;
•	Feinstein failed to conduct an accurate and thorough risk analysis of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all of the ePHI held by Feinstein, including the ePHI on the aforementioned laptop computer;
•	Feinstein failed to implement policies and procedures for granting access to ePHI by its workforce members;
•	Feinstein failed to implement physical safeguards for a laptop that contained ePHI to restrict access to unauthorized users;
•	Feinstein failed to implement policies and procedures that govern receipt and removal of hardware and electronic media that contain ePHI into and out of a facility, and the movement of these items within the facility; and,
•	Feinstein failed to implement a mechanism to encrypt ePHI or, alternatively, document why encryption was not reasonable and appropriate and implement an equivalent alternative measure to encryption to safeguard ePHI. 
The settlement requires Feinstein to establish a comprehensive compliance program designed to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of ePHI that includes:
•	A risk analysis and a risk management plan;
•	A process to evaluate and address any environmental or operational changes that affect the security of the ePHI it holds;
•	Policies and procedures to facilitate compliance with requirements of the HIPAA Rules;
•	A training program covering the requirements of the Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules, intended to be used for all members of the workforce.

2012-11-05,Women and Infant's Hospital ,Rhode Island,PHYS,MED,14004,"Care New England Health System (CNE), on behalf of each of the covered entities under its common ownership or control, has agreed to settle potential violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules.  The settlement includes a monetary payment of $400,000 and a comprehensive corrective action plan. CNE provides centralized corporate support for its subsidiary affiliated covered entities, which include a number of hospitals and health care providers in Massachusetts and Rhode Island.  These functions include, but are not limited to, finance, human resources, information services and technical support, insurance, compliance and administrative functions. 
On November 5, 2012, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (OCR) received notification from Woman & Infants Hospital of Rhode Island (WIH), a covered entity member of CNE, of the loss of unencrypted backup tapes containing the ultrasound studies of approximately 14,000 individuals, including patient name, data of birth, date of exam, physician names, and, in some instances Social Security Numbers.  As WIH’s business associate, CNE provides centralized corporate support including technical support and information security for WIH’s information systems.  WIH provided OCR with a business associate agreement with Care New England Health System effective March 15, 2005, that was not updated until August 28, 2015, as a result of OCR’s investigation, and therefore, did not incorporate revisions required under the HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule.
OCR’s investigation found the following:
•	From September 23, 2014 until August 28, 2015, WIH disclosed protected health information (PHI) and allowed its business associate, CNE, to create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI on its behalf, without obtaining satisfactory assurances as required under HIPAA.  WIH failed to renew or modify its existing written business associate agreement with CNE to include the applicable implementation specifications required by the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules.
•	From September 23, 2014, until August 28, 2015, WIH impermissibly disclosed the PHI of at least 14,004 individuals to its business associate when WIH provided CNE with access to PHI without obtaining satisfactory assurances, in the form of a written business associate agreement, that CNE would appropriately safeguard the PHI.
“This case illustrates the vital importance of reviewing and updating, as necessary, business associate agreements, especially in light of required revisions under the Omnibus Final Rule, said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels. “The Omnibus Final Rule outlined necessary changes to established business associate agreements and new requirements which include provisions for reporting.  A sample Business Associate Agreement can be found on OCR’s website to assist covered entities in complying with this requirement.”
With respect to the underlying breach, on July 17, 2014, WIH entered into a consent judgment with the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office (AGO), and reached a settlement of $150,000.  OCR found the consent judgment to sufficiently cover most of the conduct in this breach, including the failure to implement appropriate safeguards related to the handling of the PHI contained on the backup tapes and the failure to provide timely notification to the affected individuals. While the AGO’s actions do not legally preclude OCR from imposing civil money penalties, OCR determined not to include additional potential violations in this case for the purposes of settlement, given that such potential violations had already been addressed by the AGO and based on OCR’s policy approach to concurrent cases with State AGOs.  The Resolution Agreement and Corrective Action Plan may be found on the OCR website athttp://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/compliance-enforcement/agreem...

2013-03-21,University of Mississippi Medical Center,Mississippi,PHYS,MED,500,"The University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) has agreed to settle multiple alleged violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights (OCR).  OCR’s investigation of UMMC was triggered by a breach of unsecured electronic protected health information (“ePHI”) affecting approximately 10,000 individuals.  During the investigation, OCR determined that UMMC was aware of risks and vulnerabilities to its systems as far back as April 2005, yet no significant risk management activity occurred until after the breach, due largely to organizational deficiencies and insufficient institutional oversight.  UMMC will pay a resolution amount of $2,750,000 and adopt a corrective action plan to help assure future compliance with HIPAA Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules. 
“In addition to identifying risks and vulnerabilities to their ePHI, entities must also implement reasonable and appropriate safeguards to address them within an appropriate time frame,” said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels.  “We at OCR remain particularly concerned with unaddressed risks that may lead to impermissible access to ePHI.”
On March 21, 2013, OCR was notified of a breach after UMMC’s privacy officer discovered that a password-protected laptop was missing from UMMC’s Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU).  UMMC's investigation concluded that it had likely been stolen by a visitor to the MICU who had inquired about borrowing one of the laptops.  OCR’s investigation revealed that ePHI stored on a UMMC network drive was vulnerable to unauthorized access via UMMC’s wireless network because users could access an active directory containing 67,000 files after entering a generic username and password.  The directory included 328 files containing the ePHI of an estimated 10,000 patients dating back to 2008.
Further, OCR’s investigation revealed that UMMC failed to:
•implement its policies and procedures to prevent, detect, contain, and correct security violations;
•implement physical safeguards for all workstations that access ePHI to restrict access to authorized users;
•assign a unique user name and/or number for identifying and tracking user identity in information systems containing ePHI; and
•notify each individual whose unsecured ePHI was reasonably believed to have been accessed, acquired, used, or disclosed as a result of the breach.
University of Mississippi is the state’s sole public academic health science center with education and research functions.  In addition it provides patient care in four specialized hospitals on the Jackson campus and at clinics throughout Jackson and the state. Its designated health care component, UMMC, includes University Hospital, the site of the breach in this case, located on the main UMMC campus in Jackson.

2013-04-30,Raleigh Orthopaedic Clinic,North Carolina,DISC,MED,17300,"Raleigh Orthopaedic Clinic, P.A. of North Carolina (Raleigh Orthopaedic) has agreed to pay $750,000 to settle charges that it potentially violated the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy Rule by handing over protected health information (PHI) for approximately 17,300 patients to a potential business partner without first executing a business associate agreement.  HIPAA covered entities cannot disclose PHI to unauthorized persons, and the lack of a business associate agreement left this sensitive health information without safeguards and vulnerable to misuse or improper disclosure.  Raleigh Orthopaedic is a provider group practice that operates clinics and an orthopaedic surgery center in the Raleigh, North Carolina area.
OCR initiated its investigation of Raleigh Orthopaedic following receipt of a breach report on April 30, 2013.  OCR’s investigation indicated that Raleigh Orthopaedic released the x-ray films and related protected health information of 17,300 patients to an entity that promised to transfer the images to electronic media in exchange for harvesting the silver from the x-ray films.  Raleigh Orthopedic failed to execute a business associate agreement with this entity prior to turning over the x-rays (and PHI).
“HIPAA’s obligation on covered entities to obtain business associate agreements is more than a mere check-the-box paperwork exercise,” said Jocelyn Samuels, Director of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR). “It is critical for entities to know to whom they are handing PHI and to obtain assurances that the information will be protected.”
In addition to the $750,000 payment, Raleigh Orthopaedic is required to revise its policies and procedures to: establish a process for assessing whether entities are business associates; designate a responsible individual to ensure business associate agreements are in place prior to disclosing PHI to a business associate; create a standard template business associate agreement; establish a standard process for maintaining documentation of a business associate agreements for at least six (6) years beyond the date of termination of a business associate relationship; and limit disclosures of PHI to any business associate to the minimum necessary to accomplish the purpose for which the business associate was hired.

2013-07-10,Children's Medical Center of Dallas,Texas,PHYS,MED,2462,"Lack of timely action risks security and costs money
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights (OCR), has announced a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) civil money penalty against Children’s Medical Center of Dallas (Children’s) based on its impermissible disclosure of unsecured electronic protected health information (ePHI) and non-compliance over many years with multiple standards of the HIPAA Security Rule.  OCR issued a Notice of Proposed Determination in accordance with 45 CFR 160.420, which included instruction for how Children’s could file a request for a hearing. Children’s did not request a hearing. Accordingly, OCR issued a Notice of Final Determination and Children's paid the full civil money penalty of $3.2 million. Children’s is a pediatric hospital in Dallas, Texas, and is part of Children’s Health, the seventh largest pediatric health care provider in the nation.
On January 18, 2010, Children’s filed a breach report with OCR indicating the loss of an unencrypted, non-password protected BlackBerry device at the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport on November 19, 2009.  The device contained the ePHI of approximately 3,800 individuals.  On July 5, 2013, Children's filed a separate HIPAA Breach Notification Report with OCR, reporting the theft of an unencrypted laptop from its premises sometime between April 4 and April 9, 2013. Children's reported the device contained the ePHI of 2,462 individuals. Although Children's implemented some physical safeguards to the laptop storage area (e.g., badge access and a security camera at one of the entrances), it also provided access to the area to workforce not authorized to access ePHI.
OCR’s investigation revealed Children’s noncompliance with HIPAA Rules, specifically, a failure to implement risk management plans, contrary to prior external recommendations to do so, and a failure to deploy encryption or an equivalent alternative measure on all of its laptops, work stations, mobile devices and removable storage media until April 9, 2013.  Despite Children's knowledge about the risk of maintaining unencrypted ePHI on its devices as far back as 2007, Children's issued unencrypted BlackBerry devices to nurses and allowed its workforce members to continue using unencrypted laptops and other mobile devices until 2013.  “Ensuring adequate security precautions to protect health information, including identifying any security risks and immediately correcting them, is essential” said OCR Acting Director Robinsue Frohboese. “Although OCR prefers to settle cases and assist entities in implementing corrective action plans, a lack of risk management not only costs individuals the security of their data, but it can also cost covered entities a sizable fine.”

2013-07-28,Oregon Health & Science University,Oregon,DISC,MED,1361,"Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) has agreed to settle potential violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules following an investigation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (OCR) that found widespread and diverse problems at OHSU, which will be addressed through a comprehensive three-year corrective action plan.  The settlement includes a monetary payment by OHSU to the Department for $2,700,000.   
OCR’s investigation began after OHSU submitted multiple breach reports affecting thousands of individuals, including two reports involving unencrypted laptops and another large breach involving a stolen unencrypted thumb drive.  These incidents each garnered significant local and national press coverage. OCR’s investigation uncovered evidence of widespread vulnerabilities within OHSU’s HIPAA compliance program, including the storage of the electronic protected health information (ePHI) of over 3,000 individuals on a cloud-based server without a business associate agreement.  OCR found significant risk of harm to 1,361 of these individuals due to the sensitive nature of their diagnoses.
OHSU performed risk analyses in 2003, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2013, but OCR’s investigation found that these analyses did not cover all ePHI in OHSU’s enterprise, as required by the Security Rule.  While the analyses identified vulnerabilities and risks to ePHI located in many areas of the organization, OHSU did not act in a timely manner to implement measures to address these documented risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and appropriate level. OHSU also lacked policies and procedures to prevent, detect, contain, and correct security violations and failed to implement a mechanism to encrypt and decrypt ePHI or an equivalent alternative measure for ePHI maintained on its workstations, despite having identified this lack of encryption as a risk.
“From well-publicized large scale breaches and findings in their own risk analyses, OHSU had every opportunity to address security management processes that were insufficient.  Furthermore, OHSU should have addressed the lack of a business associate agreement before allowing a vendor to store ePHI,” said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels.  “This settlement underscores the importance of leadership engagement and why it is so critical for the C-suite to take HIPAA compliance seriously.”
OHSU is a large public academic health center and research university centered in Portland, Oregon, comprising two hospitals, and multiple general and specialty clinics throughout Portland and throughout the State of Oregon.

2013-08-23,"Advocate Health and Hospitals Corporation, d/b/a Advocate Medical Group",Illinois,PHYS,MED,4029530,"Advocate Health Care Network (Advocate) has agreed to a settlement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights (OCR), for multiple potential violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) involving electronic protected health information (ePHI). Advocate has agreed to pay a settlement amount of $5.55 million and adopt a corrective action plan.  This significant settlement, the largest to-date against a single entity, is a result of the extent and duration of the alleged noncompliance (dating back to the inception of the Security Rule in some instances), the involvement of the State Attorney General in a corresponding investigation, and the large number of individuals whose information was affected by Advocate, one of the largest health systems in the country.
“We hope this settlement sends a strong message to covered entities that they must engage in a comprehensive risk analysis and risk management to ensure that individuals’ ePHI is secure,” said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels. “This includes implementing physical, technical, and administrative security measures sufficient to reduce the risks to ePHI in all physical locations and on all portable devices to a reasonable and appropriate level.”
OCR began its investigation in 2013, when Advocate submitted three breach notification reports pertaining to separate and distinct incidents involving its subsidiary, Advocate Medical Group (""AMG""). The combined breaches affected the ePHI of approximately 4 million individuals.  The ePHI included demographic information, clinical information, health insurance information, patient names, addresses, credit card numbers and their expiration dates, and dates of birth. OCR’s investigations into these incidents revealed that Advocate failed to:
•conduct an accurate and thorough assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to all of its ePHI;
•implement policies and procedures and facility access controls to limit physical access to the electronic information systems housed within a large data support center;
•obtain satisfactory assurances in the form of a written business associate contract that its business associate would appropriately safeguard all ePHI in its possession; and
•reasonably safeguard an unencrypted laptop when left in an unlocked vehicle overnight.
Advocate Health Care Network is the largest fully-integrated health care system in Illinois, with more than 250 treatment locations, including ten acute-care hospitals and two integrated children's hospitals. Its subsidiary, AMG, is a nonprofit physician-led medical group that provides primary care, medical imaging, outpatient and specialty services throughout the Chicago area and in Bloomington-Normal, Illinois.

Advocate has agreed to pay a settlement amount of $5.55 million and adopt a corrective action plan.  This significant settlement, the largest to-date against a single entity, is a result of the extent and duration of the alleged noncompliance (dating back to the inception of the Security Rule in some instances), the involvement of the State Attorney General in a corresponding investigation, and the large number of individuals whose information was affected by Advocate, one of the largest health systems in the country.
“We hope this settlement sends a strong message to covered entities that they must engage in a comprehensive risk analysis and risk management to ensure that individuals’ ePHI is secure,” said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels. “This includes implementing physical, technical, and administrative security measures sufficient to reduce the risks to ePHI in all physical locations and on all portable devices to a reasonable and appropriate level.”
OCR began its investigation in 2013, when Advocate submitted three breach notification reports pertaining to separate and distinct incidents involving its subsidiary, Advocate Medical Group (""AMG""). The combined breaches affected the ePHI of approximately 4 million individuals.  The ePHI included demographic information, clinical information, health insurance information, patient names, addresses, credit card numbers and their expiration dates, and dates of birth. OCR’s investigations into these incidents revealed that Advocate failed to:
•conduct an accurate and thorough assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to all of its ePHI;
•implement policies and procedures and facility access controls to limit physical access to the electronic information systems housed within a large data support center;
•obtain satisfactory assurances in the form of a written business associate contract that its business associate would appropriately safeguard all ePHI in its possession; and
•reasonably safeguard an unencrypted laptop when left in an unlocked vehicle overnight.
Advocate Health Care Network is the largest fully-integrated health care system in Illinois, with more than 250 treatment locations, including ten acute-care hospitals and two integrated children's hospitals. Its subsidiary, AMG, is a nonprofit physician-led medical group that provides primary care, medical imaging, outpatient and specialty services throughout the Chicago area and in Bloomington-Normal, Illinois.

2013-11-01,Advocate Health and Hospitals Corporation,Illinois,PHYS,MED,2237,"Advocate Health Care Network (Advocate) has agreed to a settlement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights (OCR), for multiple potential violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) involving electronic protected health information (ePHI). Advocate has agreed to pay a settlement amount of $5.55 million and adopt a corrective action plan.  This significant settlement, the largest to-date against a single entity, is a result of the extent and duration of the alleged noncompliance (dating back to the inception of the Security Rule in some instances), the involvement of the State Attorney General in a corresponding investigation, and the large number of individuals whose information was affected by Advocate, one of the largest health systems in the country.
“We hope this settlement sends a strong message to covered entities that they must engage in a comprehensive risk analysis and risk management to ensure that individuals’ ePHI is secure,” said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels. “This includes implementing physical, technical, and administrative security measures sufficient to reduce the risks to ePHI in all physical locations and on all portable devices to a reasonable and appropriate level.”
OCR began its investigation in 2013, when Advocate submitted three breach notification reports pertaining to separate and distinct incidents involving its subsidiary, Advocate Medical Group (""AMG""). The combined breaches affected the ePHI of approximately 4 million individuals.  The ePHI included demographic information, clinical information, health insurance information, patient names, addresses, credit card numbers and their expiration dates, and dates of birth. OCR’s investigations into these incidents revealed that Advocate failed to:
•conduct an accurate and thorough assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to all of its ePHI;
•implement policies and procedures and facility access controls to limit physical access to the electronic information systems housed within a large data support center;
•obtain satisfactory assurances in the form of a written business associate contract that its business associate would appropriately safeguard all ePHI in its possession; and
•reasonably safeguard an unencrypted laptop when left in an unlocked vehicle overnight.
Advocate Health Care Network is the largest fully-integrated health care system in Illinois, with more than 250 treatment locations, including ten acute-care hospitals and two integrated children's hospitals. Its subsidiary, AMG, is a nonprofit physician-led medical group that provides primary care, medical imaging, outpatient and specialty services throughout the Chicago area and in Bloomington-Normal, Illinois.

2013-11-27,"UW Medicine, Privacy Manager - Breach",Washington,HACK,MED,76183,"The University of Washington Medicine (UWM) has agreed to settle charges that it potentially violated the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Security Rule by failing to implement policies and procedures to prevent, detect, contain, and correct security violations.  UWM is an affiliated covered entity, which includes designated health care components and other entities under the control of the University of Washington, including University of Washington Medical Center, the primary teaching hospital of the University of Washington School of Medicine.  Affiliated covered entities must have in place appropriate policies and processes to assure HIPAA compliance with respect to each of the entities that are part of the affiliated group.  The settlement includes a monetary payment of $750,000, a corrective action plan, and annual reports on the organization’s compliance efforts.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (OCR) initiated its investigation of the UWM following receipt of a breach report on November 27, 2013, which indicated that the electronic protected health information (e-PHI) of approximately 90,000 individuals was accessed after an employee downloaded an email attachment that contained malicious malware. The malware compromised the organization’s IT system, affecting the data of two different groups of patients:  1) approximately 76,000 patients involving a combination of patient names, medical record numbers, dates of service, and/or charges or bill balances; and 2) approximately 15,000 patients involving names, medical record numbers, other demographics such as address and phone number, dates of birth, charges or bill balances, social security numbers, insurance identification or Medicare numbers.
OCR’s investigation indicated UWM’s security policies required its affiliated entities to have up-to-date, documented system-level risk assessments and to implement safeguards in compliance with the Security Rule.  However, UWM did not ensure that all of its affiliated entities were properly conducting risk assessments and appropriately responding to the potential risks and vulnerabilities in their respective environments.
“All too often we see covered entities with a limited risk analysis that focuses on a specific system such as the electronic medical record or that fails to provide appropriate oversight and accountability for all parts of the enterprise,” said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels.  “An effective risk analysis is one that is comprehensive in scope and is conducted across the organization to sufficiently address the risks and vulnerabilities to patient data.”

2014-01-24,"Triple-S Salud, Inc. - Breach Case#2",Puerto Rico,PHYS,MED,398000,"Triple-S Management Corporation (“TRIPLE-S”), on behalf of its wholly owned subsidiaries, Triple-S Salud Inc., Triple-C Inc. and Triple-S Advantage Inc. , formerly known as American Health Medicare Inc., has agreed to settle potential violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights (OCR).  TRIPLE-S will pay $3.5 million and will adopt a robust corrective action plan to correct deficiencies in its HIPAA compliance program, an effort it has already begun.
“OCR remains committed to strong enforcement of the HIPAA Rules,” said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels. “This case sends an important message for HIPAA Covered Entities not only about compliance with the requirements of the Security Rule, including risk analysis, but compliance with the requirements of the Privacy Rule, including those addressing business associate agreements and the minimum necessary use of protected health information.”
TRIPLE-S is an insurance holding company based in San Juan, Puerto Rico, which offers a wide range of insurance products and services to residents of Puerto Rico through its subsidiaries.  TRIPLE-S has fully cooperated with HHS in investigating this case and has agreed to put in place a comprehensive HIPAA compliance program as a condition for settlement.  
After receiving multiple breach notifications from TRIPLE-S involving unsecured protected health information (PHI), OCR initiated investigations to ascertain the entities’ compliance with HIPAA Rules. OCR’s investigations indicated widespread non-compliance throughout the various subsidiaries of Triple-S, including:
Failure to implement appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the privacy of its beneficiaries’ PHI;
Impermissible disclosure of its beneficiaries’ PHI to an outside vendor with which it did not have an appropriate business associate agreement;
Use or Disclosure of more PHI than was necessary to carry out mailings;
Failure to conduct an accurate and thorough risk analysis that incorporates all IT equipment, applications, and data systems utilizing ePHI; and
Failure to implement security measures sufficient to reduce the risks and vulnerabilities to its ePHI to a reasonable and appropriate level.
The settlement requires TRIPLE-S to establish a comprehensive compliance program designed to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the personal information it collects from its beneficiaries, that includes:
A risk analysis and a risk management plan;
A process to evaluate and address any environmental or operational changes that affect the security of the ePHI it holds;
Policies and procedures to facilitate compliance with requirements of the HIPAA Rules; and
A training program covering the requirements of the Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules, intended to be used for all members of the workforce and business associates providing services on TRIPLE-S premises.
Triple-S, with the help of OCR through its technical assistance, had already begun to take extensive corrective action, as required by the Corrective Action Plan, and will continue to work with OCR to come into compliance with HIPAA.
“Triple-S is committed to protecting the privacy and security of its beneficiaries’ health information and implementing the Corrective Action Plan entered into with OCR,” said President and CEO of Triple-S Management Corporation, Ramon M. Ruiz.  “We are pleased with the agreement and regard it as an opportunity to strengthen our privacy policies. We have appreciated OCR’s technical assistance to date, and look forward to our collaboration in the future.”

TRIPLE-S will pay $3.5 million and will adopt a robust corrective action plan to correct deficiencies in its HIPAA compliance program, an effort it has already begun.
“OCR remains committed to strong enforcement of the HIPAA Rules,” said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels. “This case sends an important message for HIPAA Covered Entities not only about compliance with the requirements of the Security Rule, including risk analysis, but compliance with the requirements of the Privacy Rule, including those addressing business associate agreements and the minimum necessary use of protected health information.”
TRIPLE-S is an insurance holding company based in San Juan, Puerto Rico, which offers a wide range of insurance products and services to residents of Puerto Rico through its subsidiaries.  TRIPLE-S has fully cooperated with HHS in investigating this case and has agreed to put in place a comprehensive HIPAA compliance program as a condition for settlement.  
After receiving multiple breach notifications from TRIPLE-S involving unsecured protected health information (PHI), OCR initiated investigations to ascertain the entities’ compliance with HIPAA Rules. OCR’s investigations indicated widespread non-compliance throughout the various subsidiaries of Triple-S, including:
Failure to implement appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the privacy of its beneficiaries’ PHI;
Impermissible disclosure of its beneficiaries’ PHI to an outside vendor with which it did not have an appropriate business associate agreement;
Use or Disclosure of more PHI than was necessary to carry out mailings;
Failure to conduct an accurate and thorough risk analysis that incorporates all IT equipment, applications, and data systems utilizing ePHI; and
Failure to implement security measures sufficient to reduce the risks and vulnerabilities to its ePHI to a reasonable and appropriate level.
The settlement requires TRIPLE-S to establish a comprehensive compliance program designed to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the personal information it collects from its beneficiaries, that includes:
A risk analysis and a risk management plan;
A process to evaluate and address any environmental or operational changes that affect the security of the ePHI it holds;
Policies and procedures to facilitate compliance with requirements of the HIPAA Rules; and
A training program covering the requirements of the Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules, intended to be used for all members of the workforce and business associates providing services on TRIPLE-S premises.
Triple-S, with the help of OCR through its technical assistance, had already begun to take extensive corrective action, as required by the Corrective Action Plan, and will continue to work with OCR to come into compliance with HIPAA.
“Triple-S is committed to protecting the privacy and security of its beneficiaries’ health information and implementing the Corrective Action Plan entered into with OCR,” said President and CEO of Triple-S Management Corporation, Ramon M. Ruiz.  “We are pleased with the agreement and regard it as an opportunity to strengthen our privacy policies. We have appreciated OCR’s technical assistance to date, and look forward to our collaboration in the future.”

2014-05-18,American Health Inc. ,Puerto Rico,DISC,MED,11531,"Triple-S Management Corporation (“TRIPLE-S”), on behalf of its wholly owned subsidiaries, Triple-S Salud Inc., Triple-C Inc. and Triple-S Advantage Inc. , formerly known as American Health Medicare Inc., has agreed to settle potential violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy and Security Rules with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for Civil Rights (OCR).  TRIPLE-S will pay $3.5 million and will adopt a robust corrective action plan to correct deficiencies in its HIPAA compliance program, an effort it has already begun.
“OCR remains committed to strong enforcement of the HIPAA Rules,” said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels. “This case sends an important message for HIPAA Covered Entities not only about compliance with the requirements of the Security Rule, including risk analysis, but compliance with the requirements of the Privacy Rule, including those addressing business associate agreements and the minimum necessary use of protected health information.”
TRIPLE-S is an insurance holding company based in San Juan, Puerto Rico, which offers a wide range of insurance products and services to residents of Puerto Rico through its subsidiaries.  TRIPLE-S has fully cooperated with HHS in investigating this case and has agreed to put in place a comprehensive HIPAA compliance program as a condition for settlement.  
After receiving multiple breach notifications from TRIPLE-S involving unsecured protected health information (PHI), OCR initiated investigations to ascertain the entities’ compliance with HIPAA Rules. OCR’s investigations indicated widespread non-compliance throughout the various subsidiaries of Triple-S, including:
Failure to implement appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the privacy of its beneficiaries’ PHI;
Impermissible disclosure of its beneficiaries’ PHI to an outside vendor with which it did not have an appropriate business associate agreement;
Use or Disclosure of more PHI than was necessary to carry out mailings;
Failure to conduct an accurate and thorough risk analysis that incorporates all IT equipment, applications, and data systems utilizing ePHI; and
Failure to implement security measures sufficient to reduce the risks and vulnerabilities to its ePHI to a reasonable and appropriate level.
The settlement requires TRIPLE-S to establish a comprehensive compliance program designed to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the personal information it collects from its beneficiaries, that includes:
A risk analysis and a risk management plan;
A process to evaluate and address any environmental or operational changes that affect the security of the ePHI it holds;
Policies and procedures to facilitate compliance with requirements of the HIPAA Rules; and
A training program covering the requirements of the Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules, intended to be used for all members of the workforce and business associates providing services on TRIPLE-S premises.
Triple-S, with the help of OCR through its technical assistance, had already begun to take extensive corrective action, as required by the Corrective Action Plan, and will continue to work with OCR to come into compliance with HIPAA.
“Triple-S is committed to protecting the privacy and security of its beneficiaries’ health information and implementing the Corrective Action Plan entered into with OCR,” said President and CEO of Triple-S Management Corporation, Ramon M. Ruiz.  “We are pleased with the agreement and regard it as an opportunity to strengthen our privacy policies. We have appreciated OCR’s technical assistance to date, and look forward to our collaboration in the future.”

TRIPLE-S will pay $3.5 million and will adopt a robust corrective action plan to correct deficiencies in its HIPAA compliance program, an effort it has already begun.
“OCR remains committed to strong enforcement of the HIPAA Rules,” said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels. “This case sends an important message for HIPAA Covered Entities not only about compliance with the requirements of the Security Rule, including risk analysis, but compliance with the requirements of the Privacy Rule, including those addressing business associate agreements and the minimum necessary use of protected health information.”
TRIPLE-S is an insurance holding company based in San Juan, Puerto Rico, which offers a wide range of insurance products and services to residents of Puerto Rico through its subsidiaries.  TRIPLE-S has fully cooperated with HHS in investigating this case and has agreed to put in place a comprehensive HIPAA compliance program as a condition for settlement.  
After receiving multiple breach notifications from TRIPLE-S involving unsecured protected health information (PHI), OCR initiated investigations to ascertain the entities’ compliance with HIPAA Rules. OCR’s investigations indicated widespread non-compliance throughout the various subsidiaries of Triple-S, including:
Failure to implement appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the privacy of its beneficiaries’ PHI;
Impermissible disclosure of its beneficiaries’ PHI to an outside vendor with which it did not have an appropriate business associate agreement;
Use or Disclosure of more PHI than was necessary to carry out mailings;
Failure to conduct an accurate and thorough risk analysis that incorporates all IT equipment, applications, and data systems utilizing ePHI; and
Failure to implement security measures sufficient to reduce the risks and vulnerabilities to its ePHI to a reasonable and appropriate level.
The settlement requires TRIPLE-S to establish a comprehensive compliance program designed to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the personal information it collects from its beneficiaries, that includes:
A risk analysis and a risk management plan;
A process to evaluate and address any environmental or operational changes that affect the security of the ePHI it holds;
Policies and procedures to facilitate compliance with requirements of the HIPAA Rules; and
A training program covering the requirements of the Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules, intended to be used for all members of the workforce and business associates providing services on TRIPLE-S premises.

The state said those families should monitor for fraud alerts that signal improper use of their personal information.State officials added that there's no evidence that unauthorized people have accessed the records — they just don't know where the records currently are located.On April 20, two parcels holding billing records that contained ""protected health information"" were mailed to the state's billing contractor, Midwest Medical Practice Management of Carbondale, Illinois. The records were mailed to allow the out-of-state vendor to bill for newborn-screening services performed by ADHS.Both parcels were sent via the U.S. Postal Service, but only one arrived. According to a statement released by ADHS, a tracking website showed the parcel reached a Postal Service facility in Phoenix on the night of April 20.

2017-06-05,Dr. Zain Kadri,California,INSD,MED,15000,"""The theft of confidential files from a prominent Beverly Hills surgeon could affect the privacy and financial security of as many as 15,000 patients, according to a spokesman for the doctor and law enforcement officials.A statement issued by Dr. Zain Kadri’s office said a former staff member “stole credit card information, debit card information, IDs, copies of checks, usernames, passwords” and photographed patients before and during surgery. A spokesman for Kadri’s office, who declined to be identified, said the theft might affect patients in at least 17 states and seven countries outside the United States.“Despite having only recently being discovered, the breach, which affects thousands of patients, started shortly after the ... staffer was hired in September of 2016,” the statement read.A Palmdale residence belonging to Kadri was also burglarized May 5, according to a statement issued Thursday by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. Patient files, medical supplies and electronic devices were stolen, authorities said. Kadri’s spokesman described the residence as an “administrative office” the surgeon uses when performing procedures in a Palmdale office.“Nobody knows it’s there except for us. It’s our registered address for all business documents,” the spokesman said.Though Kadri said in the statement that he believes the break-in was carried out by the same employee, the Sheriff’s Department said there were no witnesses. Investigators want to question the ex-employee, who has not yet been detained, according to the department statement.Calls to the Palmdale Sheriff’s Station on Friday seeking additional comment were not immediately returned.Kadri’s office also learned recently that an Instagram account was created to host what are believed to be illegal recordings of patients during surgery. The account, which contains videos of procedures and pictures of patients, published its earliest post in January.“These patients did not approve this,” the spokesman said. “We did not approve this.”The employee was hired as a driver for Kadri in September 2016, and over time she began to take on additional duties. She quit in March of this year after Kadri and his staff accused her of embezzling from the company, the spokesman said.""",Media,http://enewspaper.latimes.com/infinity/article_popover_share.aspx?guid=0511a587-c9aa-4ea2-a331-64f54856baeb,2017,34.07362,-118.400356,Others,Insider,Others,Others,West,West,16,F_regulated,Others,0.01803817111389031,10.0,7,10,17.0,20.0,27.0,9.0,3.0

The Daily spoke to vice president for admissions and records Matt Hamilton Tuesday afternoon, when he said OU IT was aware of the breach and was working to secure the files.OU press secretary Matt Epting provided the following statement late Tuesday night: “The IT Security team has found no evidence to confirm that there has been a breach by an outside party, and is investigating the scenario that enabled an individual to access the files the individual has claimed to download.”At no point did The Daily suggest there had been an outside breach, but rather that lax security measures allowed email users more access to educational records than should have been allowed.In just 30 of the hundreds of documents made publicly discoverable on Microsoft Office Delve, there were more than 29,000 instances in which students’ private information was made public to users within OU’s email system.

2017-07-22,Washington State University,Washington,PHYS,EDU,1000000,"""When thieves broke into an Olympia storage locker in April and hauled away an 85-pound locked safe, they set in motion a series of events that forced Washington State University to send letters to 1 million people advising them their data might have been compromised.The safe contained a computer hard drive — a backup containing personal information, including Social Security numbers, that was stored off-site by WSU’s Social & Economic Sciences Research Center. The center, a research arm of the university, contracts with state agencies to evaluate the quality of the data those agencies are collecting, said Phil Weiler, vice president for marketing and communication at WSU.WSU doesn’t have any idea if the thieves were able to break into the safe, if they know what to do with the hard drive, or if they’re able to interpret the data, which is stored in a relational database that requires some expertise to unravel, Weiler said. In addition, some of the files were encrypted, and some were password protected, he said.But there’s certainly a chance they’ll figure it out, which is why WSU hired a computer-forensics firm to determine what data had been backed up onto the hard drive. This month, WSU sent letters to 1 million people warning them of the breach. The university is offering those affected a year subscription to free credit-monitoring and identity-theft protection.The data includes names and a mix of personal information, including Social Security numbers for some of those affected. Some of it comes from school districts who track their students after graduation to find out if they’re going on to college, or getting jobs, Weiler said. The research center also has contracted with state job-training programs that track their clients to see if they were able to find employment.Weiler said the hard drive contained data from 1998 to 2013. Some of the research center’s work includes long-term studies that track participants over many years.""",Maryland Attorney General,http://www.marylandattorneygeneral.gov/Pages/IdentityTheft/breachnotices.aspx?subfolder=2015,2014,47.037874,-122.900695,Others,Mixed,Offline,Local,West,West,14,F_regulated,Others,1.2025447409260206,10.0,7,8,17.0,18.0,25.0,8.333333333333334,2.3333333333333335

""The problem has been corrected.""Rees said she did not know how long the information was viewable onlineLetters were sent to affected individuals or their families on June 30, she said, and the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania worked with county government solicitors across the state on a probe into what caused the data breach.CCAP is a statewide association that represents county commissioners, chief clerks, administrators and solicitors. It also represents county council members and executives in home-rule charter counties such as Erie County.The organization, according to Erie County officials, also consulted with lawyers expert in cyber law and a digital forensics company regarding the data breach, and put protective measures in place.

PIN codes are used to confirm the identity of people who call for customer service.No loss or theft of customer information occurred, Verizon told CNN Tech.UpGuard -- the same company that discovered leaked voter data in June -- initially said the error could impact up to 14 million accounts.Chris Vickery, a researcher at UpGuard, discovered the Verizon data was exposed by NICE Systems, an Israel-based company Verizon was working with to facilitate customer service calls. The data was collected over the last six months.Vickery alerted Verizon to the leak on June 13. The security hole was closed on June 22.The incident stemmed from NICE security measures that were not set up properly. The company made a security setting public, instead of private, on an Amazon S3 storage server -- a common technology used by businesses to keep data in the cloud.

Sabre did not specify when or how the actual intrusion took place or how many records are potentially affected.

According to Sabre’s marketing literature, more than 32,000 properties use Sabre’s SynXis reservations system.Sabre told customers that it didn’t have any additional details about the breach to share at this time, so it remains unclear what the exact cause of the breach may be or for how long it may have persisted, reports Krebs on Security.
